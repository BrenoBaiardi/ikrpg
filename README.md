# IKRPG for Foundry VTT

### ***This is a WORK IN PROGRESS***

**IKRPG** (Iron Kingdoms Roleplaying Game) is a custom system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, built to support the
mechanics and flavor of the Iron Kingdoms universe.  
This project was designed from the ground up to faithfully implement character sheets, dice rolls, inventory, and
derived stats according to the IKRPG rules.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This system aims to provide a structured and automated character sheet for use in campaigns set in the Iron Kingdoms
setting, with a focus on:

- Clean, functional, and modular character sheets
- Automatic dice rolls using 2d6 + modifiers
- Attribute-driven derived values (like HP, DEF, ARM)
- Fully customizable skill system with fixed skill names and editable attributes/levels
- Categorized inventory management with dynamic weapon rolls
- Support for actor types: Character, NPC, Steamjack

  - Works with square and hex grids
  - Updates on rotation with automatic angle snapping
