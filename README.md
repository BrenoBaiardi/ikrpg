# IKRPG for Foundry VTT

**IKRPG** (Iron Kingdoms Roleplaying Game) is a custom system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, built to support the mechanics and flavor of the Iron Kingdoms universe.  
This project was designed from the ground up to faithfully implement character sheets, dice rolls, inventory, and derived stats according to the IKRPG rules.

## üéØ Purpose

This system aims to provide a structured and automated character sheet for use in campaigns set in the Iron Kingdoms setting, with a focus on:

- Clean, functional, and modular character sheets
- Automatic dice rolls using 2d6 + modifiers
- Attribute-driven derived values (like HP, DEF, ARM)
- Fully customizable skill system with fixed skill names and editable attributes/levels
- Categorized inventory management with dynamic weapon rolls

## üß∞ Features

- **Main and Secondary Attributes**: STR, AGI, PHY, INT, PER, ARC, PRW, POI, SPD
- **Derived Attributes**: INIT, WILL, DEF, ARM, HP
- **Rollable Attributes**: Click on any attribute name to roll 2d6 + that attribute
- **Occupational & Military Skills**:
  - Predefined skill names
  - Automatic skill rolls: 2d6 + attribute + level
  - Social skills allow neutral attribute association (using `--`)
- **Dynamic Inventory System**:
  - Separate item types: melee weapons, ranged weapons, armor, and equipment
  - Dedicated inventory tabs for weapons and general equipment
  - Weapon entries allow customizable tags (e.g., "fire", "magical", "cutting") without restriction to predefined types (in hope for further development on resistances/immunities)
  - Roll attacks directly from weapon entries using associated skill rolls
- **Armor Integration**:
  - Armor equipment automatically modifies derived stats
  - Equipped/un-equipped states reflecting on DEF/ARM/MOVE
- **HP Management**:
  - Integrated buttons to easily increase or decrease HP
- **Combat**:
  - Initiative integrated into Foundry VTT's combat tracker
  - Combat rolls sent to chat and automated hit/miss and damage buttons
- **Sheet**:
  - Editable general information section with character name, HP controls.
  - Tabbed interface separating attributes, skills, and inventory

## üõ† Planned Features

- Ability and Spell management (planned architecture ready)
- Status and condition tracking (tentative, depending on complexity)
- Localization (pt-BR and en-US initially, system prepared for further languages)
- No official compendium creation (due to legal and maintenance concerns)
