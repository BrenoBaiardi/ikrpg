# IKRPG for Foundry VTT

**IKRPG** (Iron Kingdoms Roleplaying Game) is a custom system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, built to support the mechanics and flavor of the Iron Kingdoms universe. 
This project was designed from the ground up to faithfully implement character sheets, dice rolls, and derived stats according to the IKRPG rules.

## üéØ Purpose

This system aims to provide a structured and automated character sheet for use in campaigns set in the Iron Kingdoms setting, with a focus on:

- Clean, functional, and modular character sheets
- Automatic dice rolls using 2d6 + modifiers
- Attribute-driven derived values (like HP, DEF, ARM)
- Fully customizable skill system with fixed skill names and editable attributes/levels
- Support for future expansion (items, spells, mechanika, monsters)
